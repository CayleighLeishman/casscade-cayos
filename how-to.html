           <h3> Hi! Welcome to Casscade-Cayos!</h3>

           <p> In this website you will see how I navigate and manage CSS styles and methods.</p>
            
           <p>This is a Website that I created to help me learn CSS and provide a resoruces I can look
            back on when I need a refresher. 
            I am not a professional, and this is not meant to be a professional website, but 
            feel free to check it out to see how far I've come!

            <h3>Why I made this</h3>
            <p> I made this website to help me learn CSS and provide a resource I can look back on when I need a refresher. 
                I am not a professional, and this is not meant to be a professional website, but feel free to check it out to see how far I've come!</p>

        <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
            
         <p> Now Technically I shouldn't have made this webpage such a different style from the previous navigation page, 
            but I wanted to get some practice with different formats. I'm well aware this is technically against 
            web standards of accessibility as well, but this page is meant as a personal diary for how I navigate learning CSS.</p>


            <p>Again,this is more like my CSS "diary" to walk myself through how to 
            utilize CSS. So some stuff you see here may not be "best Practice" and that's okay</p>
            
        <p> While I do appraoch this from a teaching perspective,this is mainly because I
            know I'm going to need a refresher from time to time, and I find when I write
             (or in this case, type,) like it's a literal journal I tend to write in babbles. 
             That means it makes no sense, and there's almost mo cohesive language. so I've decided to try
             my hand of writing this like a journa, and utilize it as a teaching tool when I forget.
             This is also why I utilize chatgbt, to ensure 
             that what I say makes sense and flows more naturally so future me won't have to interpret
             my own babbles and get frusterated because I made no sense.             
        </p> 

        <p> The main reason I leave this public is to show people how I think, and some of the
         skillsets I've improved upon. While, this information is accurate to my understanding of how 
         things work at this time, it is not an accurate representation of everything, and CSS
         may update and improve itself as soon as i finish this diary.Who knows, all I know is to
         be willing to look unknowledgeable and be curious about what you dont yet understand.
