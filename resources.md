I like to give general credits to people that have helped me to advance my learning of CSS. 

A lot of what I learned here I learned (and sometimes direclty copied code from)  from others. I want to give credit at least provide linkes to sources that helped me learn. I wont link specific people in case
they dont want to be linked, but I will link to the sources that helped me learn.
