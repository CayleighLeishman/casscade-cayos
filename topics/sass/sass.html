 <h1>What’s SASS (or SCSS) Actually Good For?</h1>
  <p>SASS is like giving CSS a serious upgrade. SCSS is the version of SASS that plays nice
     with regular CSS. It’s a lifesaver when your project starts getting big or messy, and 
     it just helps you write cleaner, smarter styles.</p>

  <h2>Why Bother With SASS/SCSS?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Variables:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>You can save stuff like colors, spacing, or font sizes and reuse them everywhere.
             No more hunting for hex codes!</li>
        <li>Example: <code>$primary-color: #ff7f11;</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Nesting:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>It lets you group styles together the way your HTML is structured. Way more readable
             and organized.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mixins:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Think of these like reusable style snippets. Handy for stuff like centering 
            things or adding shadows.</li>
        <li>Example: <code>@mixin center-flex { display: flex; justify-content: center; 
            align-items: center; }</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Math & Logic:</strong> It can do calculations like <code>360deg / 7</code> 
        if you’re building something like a volleyball nav with 7 slices. Saves you time 
        (and a calculator).</li>
    <li><strong>Partials & Imports:</strong> Break your CSS into smaller files and import
         them into one big one. It helps keep everything way more organized.</li>
    <li><strong>Built-in Functions:</strong> You can lighten/darken colors, mess with text, 
        convert units, and more with built-in helpers.</li>
    <li><strong>Cleaner Code:</strong> You write less, repeat less, and things just feel 
        more polished.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When It’s Worth Using:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your project is getting bigger and needs structure.</li>
    <li>You want reusable styles or you’re making a design system.</li>
    <li>You’re working with others and want clean, maintainable code.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When You Might Skip It:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It’s a tiny project or quick one-off page.</li>
    <li>You don’t want to mess with extra setup or build tools.</li>
    <li>Your environment doesn’t support preprocessors at all.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Wrap-Up:</h2>
  <p>If you're already comfortable with CSS but want things to be easier, more flexible, 
    and less repetitive—SASS can really help. It's not magic, but it definitely makes
     organizing styles (and reusing them) feel way smoother—especially when you're building 
     creative layouts like volleyball navs or any page with a lot going on.</p>
