Okay, now this topic for me was and *Still is* very confusing. 

This topic is calld "specificity." It's kind of like the secret sauce to how CSS decides which styles you write in CSS gets called first, especilly whne there are multiple styles aiming at the same element. 

If you remeber we have different selectors like element, class, id, and attribute, right?

Well, specificity is how CSS figures out which one to listen to when there’s CSS that seems to tell one element "turn red" and the same sub element "turn blue."

Think of it like a priority list or a point system. The more "specific" a selector is, the more weight it carries.

When it comes to deciding which styles to apply, CSS uses a point system to determine which styles should be used first. That's what we call "specificity."

The order of importance for specificity is like this (first is most important to least important.):

###Inline styles (e.g., style="color: red;")

it would look like this:

```html
<div style="color: red;">This text is red</div>

```
These are the styles that are applied directly to the html page itself. These are considere the most important styles and css will ignore all other styles within itself if it's implemneted in the httml page.

### IDs (e.g., #header)
This is considered the most important. After Inline styles within html of course.

Which color do you think the h1 will be if you have the following html?

```html
<div id="header">
    <h1>What will this be?</h1>
    <p>This text is red. Look to the CSS and explanation to see how.</p>
</div>

<h1 id="header">What do you think this will be? Hint: I'm not in the div</h1>
```
So if you have the follows:

```css
/* the element type */
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

/* Any types that have id=header in the html code */
#header {
  color: red;
}
```
in this case, the h1 outside of the will be blue while the h1 inside of the <div> will be red! 

Here's why:
* The h1 inside the div has an ID selector (#header) applied to it, which is more *specific* than the element selector (h1) applied to the h1 outside the div.

---
### Classes eg, .header 

Class selectors apply styles to elements with a specific class. They are more specific than element selectors (like h1 or p), so the class selector will take priority over the element selector. However, if an ID selector or inline styles in the HTML are present, the ID selector will override the class selector, as IDs are more specific.

Let’s break it down with an example:
```html
<div class="header">
    <h1>What will this be?</h1>
    <p>This text is green. Look to the CSS and explanation to see how.</p>
</div>

<h1>What do you think this will be? Hint: I'm not in the div</h1>

<div class="header">
    <h1>What color will this be?</h1>
    <p>What color will this be?</p>
</div>

```
What color do you think the h1 in the .clsas will be?

```css
.header {
    color: green;  
}

h1 {
    color: blue;
}
```
The <h1> inside the div with the class ".header" will be green because the class is "more powerful" than just the <h1>, but the one outside the ".header" will be blue because it’s not inside the class.

### Elements (e.j, h1, p)
You may have picked up a pattern already, elements are the least specific (powerful) of the selectors. They're the most general and apply only to elements that don't have a parent type or class/id. 

I will explain in case you didn't see the pattern. 
For example, if you apply a style to all <h1> elements:

css
Copy code
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
This will make every <h1> tag on the page blue, regardless of where it is.

Element selectors are like saying, "I want to style all of this type" of element that aren't inside a class or ID or defined in the HTML. They apply to every instance of that element type, no matter where it is. However, if a class or ID selector targets the same element, those will take priority because they are more specific. If there’s nothing more specific (or powerful) claiming to take over, then the element style will apply.

### Universal Selectoor (e.g, *)

This will make every <h1> tag on the page blue, regardless of where it is.

Element selectors are like saying, "I want to style all of this type," and they don't have to be inside any specific parent element, class, or ID. If there's nothing more specific (like a class or ID) targeting that element, the element style will apply. However, if there is a class or ID selector, those will take priority because they are more specific.

In short, element selectors are the most general, and they apply to all instances of a certain type of tag unless something more specific is applied.
