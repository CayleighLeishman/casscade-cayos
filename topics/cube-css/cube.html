    <h3>CUBE CSS</h3>



    <p>So Cayleigh, what exactly is this for?</p>

    <p>Great question, other Cayleigh! CUBE stands for <strong>Composition, Utility, Block, Exception</strong> CSS.
      It's a methodology geared towards simplicity, pragmatism, and consistency.</p>

    <p>It’s a way to think about how to structure your CSS in a way that is easy to maintain and understand.</p>
    <p>It’s not a framework, but rather a set of principles that can be applied to any CSS project.</p>

    <p>If that doesn't make sense, don't panic! As Brother Grimmet told us, learning anything new is supposed to be tricky. 
      That's also a good thing because it means you're learning something new!</p>

    <p>So, let's break it down why it's called CUBE:</p>
    <p>Each letter in CUBE stands for something!</p>

    <!-- Interactive Cube Section -->
<div class="cube-container">

    <div class="face front">C</div>
    <div class="face back">U</div>
    <div class="face right">B</div>
    <div class="face left">E</div>
    <div class="face top"></div>
    <div class="face bottom"></div>
