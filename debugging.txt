help me keep on track as well as understanding the code better.

If anyone else does read this, good luck because hopefullly
bu the time you read this, i will have fixed the issues I had
but you wont know how to fix the issues you currently have. 


anyways:

code
___

right now O created tjhis because I thought this code was helpful for mobile view
but I'm now seeig it was kindof redudant (basically "repetetive") because 
I technically have code that ensures that it fits the screen 
a particular way.

that beign saoid I always delete code and then regret it. so Here's the code that I had

/* @media (max-width: 600px) {
    .radial-nav {
        width: 90%;
        height: auto;
        padding: 2rem;
        border-radius: 1rem;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
    }

    .choose-your-chaos {
        position: static;
        transform: none;
        margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
        pointer-events: auto;
    }

    .radial-nav a {
        position: static; /* <<< No absolute positioning */
        transform: none; /* <<< No rotating or weird movement */
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0.5rem 0;
        font-size: 1.2rem;
    } */

    
/* @media (max-width: 600px) {
    /* .radial-nav {
        width: 90%;
        height: auto;
        padding: 2rem;
        border-radius: 1rem;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
    } 

    .choose-your-chaos {
        position: static;
        transform: none;
        margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
        pointer-events: auto;
    }

    .radial-nav a {
        position: static; 
        transform: none; 
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0.5rem 0;
        font-size: 1.2rem;
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(2) {
        transform: rotate(0deg) translate(38%) rotate(-0deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(3) {
        transform: rotate(60deg) translate(38%) rotate(-60deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(4) {
        transform: rotate(120deg) translate(38%) rotate(-120deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(5) {
        transform: rotate(180deg) translate(38%) rotate(-180deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(6) {
        transform: rotate(240deg) translate(38%) rotate(-240deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(7) {
        transform: rotate(300deg) translate(38%) rotate(-300deg);
    } 
}*/

I'm not liking how the circle looks. I think I want more texture 
instead of just a solid color. 

I tjhought of doing a gradient, bu tI have that for the background. 

I also want to creat a button that allows the user to turn off any accessiblility 
features that are inconvenient for them.

I thimk I'll have it in the lower right corner, but I thought of having it elsewhere.
that being said its more consistent so I'll have it in the right corener

also, i need to ensure that its functional for mobile. 


ayways, the issue I'm going to fix is how the div looks, but I have other assingments that need to take pirority. 


I'll try to add a project for selectors and pseudo selectors down the line. 

This repository is a mess, but I think I can make it work.
mainly because I'm still fairly excited about this page being my 
"cheat sheet" for CSS to utilize in the futre.

I also want to create different templates, and maybe in the footer (or in the nav
button) have a button that allows the user to change the template.
I think that would be a fun project to do, and it would allow for accesibility, as well as a way 
for people to see differen templates I can do without having to create another "nav"
because I want the nav go be strictly for the "cheat sheet" information. 

Anyways to the proper project!
