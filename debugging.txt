since i last updated this I've kindof realized that i hadn'tw orked on my debugging txt files/ 

so heres my update for the day
i tried to write the archetect and component page, but then realized i was going to need a lot more sections for my circle navigation. It'll take awile but I['m sure it;ll be worth it in the end
for now im just going to focus on concepts I need to learn in class and use that to help futher my cheetsheet so i know what I'm stuck with ]

I wrote my debugging expereinec in grid actually about how I worked on it. So read it there 
if you're interested.

I'm going to add what CUBE CSS is so that i can learn exactly what it entails, so tha twill be another section for my navigation. 

I know the navigation is ortodox, and it's kindof meant to be. I would never use this for a real site, unless
a client really really wanted it. But i would try to encourage fo rsome consistency. To whoever is reading this,
I hope you understand that this is a "cheat sheet" for me to learn CSS and to have a place to put all the things I learn.
This is not meant to be a "real" site, but more of a place for me to act liek it's a sandbox, hense the home page of a beach in the sand.

I need to figure out hwo to make the top part look sandy. 

but righ tnow I need to get going on explaining CUBE CSS!

I also realized I put a lot of the content in the .md file an dnot an html, which is a decision I disagree with now. But that's all in a day 
of the learning process!

Boy I have not touched this in a hot minute.

So I'm looking to figute out what I wan tto do with the main page. (The index or home page) 

I'm also tryign to learn how to use figma. I'm trying to design the pages there so I can 
have a clear representative of how I want it to turn out. I'm also doing it because at least one 
job posting for web development that I've seen requires figma. And if I want to 
go into ux desing/research then I'll need to understand how to use figma.

I didnt do much today but I saw some patterns 

```css
background-color: #fff;
background-image:
linear-gradient(90deg, transparent 79px, #abced4 79px, #abced4 81px, transparent 81px),
linear-gradient(#eee .1em, transparent .1em);
background-size: 100% 1.2em;
```
this creates a lineed effect like looking at lined paper.


May 4 2025:

this is jsut a ramblings of thoughts I have whie debugging to hopefully 
help me keep on track as well as understanding the code better.

If anyone else does read this, good luck because hopefullly
bu the time you read this, i will have fixed the issues I had
but you wont know how to fix the issues you currently have. 


anyways:

code
___

right now O created tjhis because I thought this code was helpful for mobile view
but I'm now seeig it was kindof redudant (basically "repetetive") because 
I technically have code that ensures that it fits the screen 
a particular way.

that beign saoid I always delete code and then regret it. so Here's the code that I had

/* @media (max-width: 600px) {
    .radial-nav {
        width: 90%;
        height: auto;
        padding: 2rem;
        border-radius: 1rem;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
    }

    .choose-your-chaos {
        position: static;
        transform: none;
        margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
        pointer-events: auto;
    }

    .radial-nav a {
        position: static; /* <<< No absolute positioning */
        transform: none; /* <<< No rotating or weird movement */
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0.5rem 0;
        font-size: 1.2rem;
    } */

    
/* @media (max-width: 600px) {
    /* .radial-nav {
        width: 90%;
        height: auto;
        padding: 2rem;
        border-radius: 1rem;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
    } 

    .choose-your-chaos {
        position: static;
        transform: none;
        margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
        pointer-events: auto;
    }

    .radial-nav a {
        position: static; 
        transform: none; 
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0.5rem 0;
        font-size: 1.2rem;
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(2) {
        transform: rotate(0deg) translate(38%) rotate(-0deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(3) {
        transform: rotate(60deg) translate(38%) rotate(-60deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(4) {
        transform: rotate(120deg) translate(38%) rotate(-120deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(5) {
        transform: rotate(180deg) translate(38%) rotate(-180deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(6) {
        transform: rotate(240deg) translate(38%) rotate(-240deg);
    }
    .radial-nav a:nth-child(7) {
        transform: rotate(300deg) translate(38%) rotate(-300deg);
    } 
}*/
}

I'm not liking how the circle looks. I think I want more texture 
instead of just a solid color. 

I tjhought of doing a gradient, bu tI have that for the background. 

I also want to creat a button that allows the user to turn off any accessiblility 
features that are inconvenient for them.

I thimk I'll have it in the lower right corner, but I thought of having it elsewhere.
that being said its more consistent so I'll have it in the right corener

also, i need to ensure that its functional for mobile. 


ayways, the issue I'm going to fix is how the div looks, but I have other assingments that need to take pirority. 


I'll try to add a project for selectors and pseudo selectors down the line. 

This repository is a mess, but I think I can make it work.
mainly because I'm still fairly excited about this page being my 
"cheat sheet" for CSS to utilize in the futre.

I also want to create different templates, and maybe in the footer (or in the nav
button) have a button that allows the user to change the template.
I think that would be a fun project to do, and it would allow for accesibility, as well as a way 
for people to see differen templates I can do without having to create another "nav"
because I want the nav go be strictly for the "cheat sheet" information. 

Anyways to the proper project!
