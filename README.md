# casscade-cayos
Welcome to Cayleigh’s Chaos (Cayos)—a space where I try to tame the wild beast that is CSS. It’s a mess, but it’s my mess. Expect cheatsheets, practice, and personal notes from my journey through the cascade—now with 90% fewer tears (fingers-crossed).

# Project Overview

This is a personal project where I explore and learn how to make web pages look good using
CSS (that’s the styling part of websites). Over time, I’ve realized I don’t fully 
understand CSS as much as I’d like, so I created this space to help myself get better. I’m 
covering all sorts of topics I need to master, some of which I’ve struggled with in the 
past or just never fully grasped. This project will help me become more confident in 
working with CSS, and hopefully, help anyone who’s in a similar boat.


# File System Structure

Here’s a breakdown of what’s inside this GitHub Link:

- index.html: This is the homepage you see when you open the website! It’s just a "Welcome!" page for now.

- /images/: A folder with all the images I plan to use for the website. There are subfolders to help organize them by sections.

- /scripts/: Even though this project mainly focuses on CSS, this folder holds any JavaScript I’ve used (not much right now, but it’s there).

- resource-guide.md: This is where I’ve listed all the resources that have helped me—especially my chats with ChatGPT! You’ll also find links to helpful articles, tutorials, and notes from professors and peers who’ve helped me along the way.

- lessons-learned.md: This is my personal cheatsheet, full of CSS basics, tips, and tricks that I’ve learned, or been told I need to know.

# Instructions:

Here’s how you can navigate this project:

.md file: I’ve included markdown files (.md) which are like text files but with a bit more style and formatting—way more fun to read than plain text files! Here I can Write **Bold Text** or *Italics* 

index.html: This is where you can see the actual code I wrote to make the Welcome Page!

Navigation: When you open the website, you’ll see an easy way to browse through the CSS topics I’ve been working on. Go ahead and explore!


# Topics Covered

I’m learning a lot of CSS topics, and here’s what I’ve covered so far:

- Selectors: How to pick and apply styles to different parts of a webpage.

- Transitions & Animations: How to make things move and change smoothly on a page.

- Color Formats (HSL / HSLA): How to choose and work with different color systems.

- Transformations: How to adjust the shape and positioning of elements on a page.

- Layout Snippets: Handy code examples for arranging how things will be placed on a website.

# Side Note
Like it or not, no one knows everything—and I'm no exception. While I'm excited to share what I’m learning, there will always be new things to explore, which means some concepts I share may soon be outdated. But that's all part of my personal growth. We each have our own path, and I'm not comparing my progress to anyone else's, nor should anyone, "better" or "worse" compare theirs to mine. We’re all learning in our own way and at our own pace, and we don’t need to add to anyone’s imposter syndrome.

I created this project to share what I've learned and how I've grown, while also tracking my journey. There’s so much more to learn, and that’s what excites me.

While I’m committed to improving accessibility in my professional work, there's still much for me to understand. As I deepen my CSS knowledge, I’ll be inspired to add accessible features. Don’t be surprised if there are errors that conflict with W3C design guidelines—this project is about showcasing my CSS progress. In time, I’ll make it a goal add a file to explain the accessibility features I’ve implemented.

And last but not least, just remember, what I don't know yet, I can learn!
