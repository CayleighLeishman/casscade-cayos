# Advanced CSS Cheatsheet 

I asked ChatGPT to help me create a **cheatsheet** for CSS, so I can reuse this when I get stuck on a topic or a final project for example. It's packed with cool stuff that will make any websites awesome.

##  **Color Formats (HSL / HSLA)**

HSL stands for **Hue, Saturation, and Lightness**. It's a way to pick colors. 
Think of it like picking a crayon color.

- **Hue**: This is the color itself, like red, blue, or green.
- **Saturation**: How bright or dull the color is.
- **Lightness**: How light or dark the color is.

You can also make the color **see-through** by adding an **alpha** value, 
like making it fade!

### Example:
```css
hsl(122, 39%, 49%)       /* a bright green */
hsla(122, 39%, 49%, 0.4) /* a green with some see-through (40% opacity) */
```
# CSS Selectors ðŸ§­

CSS Selectors allow you to select elements on your web page so you can apply 
styles to them. Itâ€™s like pointing to things and telling CSS what to do with them.

---

## Types of CSS Selectors:

### 1. **Element Selector**
This selects elements by their tag name (like `div`, `p`, `h1`).

```html
<body>
  <p>This paragraph will be styled using the element selector in CSS.</p>
  <p>Another paragraph, styled the same way.</p>
</body>
```

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```
### 2. **Class Selector**
This selects elements with a specific class. You use "." to tell CSS "This is a class!" 
it's where you learned about "." "," ";" and so forth in class!
```html
<body>
  <div class="button">Click me!</div>
  <div class="button">Another button</div>
</body>

```

```css
.button {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### 3. **ID Selector**
This selects a specific element with a unique ID. I think of instagram with #, 
and its a personal way too identify soemthing, In class thers a group you learn from
with instagram you can see others but you learned what # did on your own.
It's typically used for more selective features where it wont apply to many 
(also better to use for JAvascript if i remember right)

```html
<body>
  <!-- note the "id=" part. This is what defines the header -->
  <div id="header">This is the header section</div>
</body>

```

```css
#header {
   font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: darkblue;
}
```

### 4. **Universal Selector**
This selects aLL elements on a page

```html
<body>
  <!-- All elements below will have margin and padding removed because of the universal selector -->
  <h1>This heading will have no margin or padding by default</h1>
  <p>This paragraph also has no padding or margin</p>
  <div>This div too!</div>
</body>

```

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```
### 5. **Attribute Selector**

This selects elements with a specific attribute.

```html:
<body>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
  <input type="password" placeholder="Enter your password">
</body>
````

```css
input[type="text"] {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 8px;
}
```

### 6. **Descendant Selector**
This selects elements that are inside other elements.
```html
<body>
  <div>
    <p>This paragraph is inside a div and will be styled.</p>
  </div>
  <p>This paragraph is not inside the div and won't be styled.</p>
</body>

```

```css
div p {
  color: green;
}
```

### 7. **Child Selector**
This selects elements that are directly inside a parent.

```html
<body>
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    <p>This paragraph is not a child of the div and won't be styled.</p>
  </div>
</body>

```

```css
ul > li {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```


### 8. **Adjacent Sibling Selector**
This selects elements that are immediately after a certain element.
```html
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This paragraph will be styled because it's immediately after the heading.</p>
  <p>This paragraph will not be styled because it comes after another paragraph.</p>
</body>
```

```css
h1 + p {
  font-size: 18px;
  color: purple;
}
```

### 9. **Pseudo-classes**

These allow you to target elements in specific states, like
when they're hovered over or clicked.

```html
<body>
  <a href="#">Hover over me!</a>
</body>
```

```css
a:hover {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### 10. **Grouping Selectors**
You can group selectors to apply the same styles to multiple elements.
```html
<body>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <h2>Subtitle</h2>
  <h3>Another heading</h3>
</body>

```

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: navy;
}
```

### 11.Combining Selectors

You can combine selectors to get more specific with your styles! For example:

```html
<body>
  <!-- This div has the class "button" so the combined selector div.button will apply -->
  <div class="button">This styled button is a div</div>

  <!-- This span also has class "button", but the style WON'T apply because it's not a div -->
  <span class="button">This will NOT be styled by div.button</span>

  <!-- This div has no class, so it won't be styled -->
  <div>This plain div will not be styled</div>
</body>

```

```css
div.button {
  background-color: teal;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  text-align: center;
```

-  Only elements that are both a <div> and have the class .button get the styles.

-  The <span class="button"> is ignored because itâ€™s not a <div>.

-  A <div> without the .button class is also ignored.
